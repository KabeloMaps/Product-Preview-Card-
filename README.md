## My process

- The process I followed for this challenge was to first focus on building the general layout of the UI for mobile screen sizes.
- This comprised of using both media queries and source tags to change the layout and img sources for different screen sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### What I learned

- How to properly use the source tags to insert a new img for certain screen sizes.

### Continued development

- Smooth transitions from mobile first design to desktop design.

### Useful resources

- ChatGPT - How to use source tags.
- Net Ninja - Mobile first responsive build.
